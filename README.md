# [Progress Bars](http://peterbinks.net/progressbars)

Simple, pure CSS progress bars that I whipped up.

## Quick start

1. Either download the repo, stick pbars.css into your CSS folder, and then link it in your <head> or
2. Copy the contents of pbars.css into your own CSS file and just use the classes.


## Features

- You can use any percentage from 1 - 100.
- Oh yeah, there's the .min version as well

## Documentation

Basically once you have the CSS in place all you have to do is add
`<div class="p-bar">
  <div class="inner onehundred"></div>
</div>`

The only part you need to change is the number class. Replace onehundred with any other number and that's the percentage that your bar will show. Though don't put a space in between the numbers ie: "seventyfive", not "seventy five".
